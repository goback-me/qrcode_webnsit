      },
      {
        "question": "What file formats are available for download?",
        "answer": "You can download your QR codes in PNG, JPG, and SVG formats. SVG is recommended for printing as it's vector-based and scales without quality loss."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I edit my QR code after generating it?",
        "answer": "Static QR codes cannot be edited once generated. If you need to change the destination URL, you'll need to create a new QR code. For editable QR codes, consider upgrading to our premium dynamic QR code feature."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I add a logo to my QR code?",
        "answer": "Simply click on Step 2 in the generator and upload your logo image (PNG, JPG, or GIF up to 10MB). The logo will be automatically centered in your QR code with a white background for optimal scanning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do QR codes expire?",
        "answer": "No, static QR codes generated with Gen QR Generator never expire. They will work indefinitely as long as the destination URL remains active."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the minimum size for a scannable QR code?",
        "answer": "For print materials, the minimum recommended size is 2 x 2 cm (0.8 x 0.8 inches). For digital displays, 150 x 150 pixels works well. Larger is always better for easier scanning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track how many times my QR code is scanned?",
        "answer": "Static QR codes don't include tracking. For analytics and scan tracking, you'll need to upgrade to our premium dynamic QR code feature which includes a full analytics dashboard."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why isn't my QR code scanning?",
        "answer": "Common issues include: QR code too small, poor image quality, insufficient contrast, damaged print, or incorrect URL format. Ensure your QR code is at least 2x2 cm and test it with multiple devices."
